# CiteCount

Citation counter script, used during the master's thesis to find out how many times each reference was cited, and quantify the most influential authors, and later, it can be transformed into a word cloud, graphics, etc.

Basically it's a regex finder and aggregator.

Generates results in csv or tex, whichever works best for the writer.

## Usage

Well, this is <s>hugely complex</s> easily changing the variables inside the script and running it with Python.

```
python3 CiteCount.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3;
- Functional latex project using cite;
